# LuoguExercises
My solutions to exercises on Luogu.

## Why on GitHub?
Actually, I'm a newbie in contests of information science, so I practise coding on Luogu. Showing my code to the public can not only drive me to simplify and beautify my code, but also enable other developers to view and change my code in order to achieve better code, because GitHub is a plaform lots of developers love.

Plus, GitHub Codespaces is also a key role in my coding process. Due to the low efficiency and old dev environment (Dev-C++) in computer in my school, I have to change to other IDEs for a better experience. Therefore, I choose GitHub Codespaces online, for its high performance container in the cloud and familiar VSCode-like UI. I hope GitHub Codespaces can boost my experience on the road to the OI.

## How to contribute?
No matter when you have a better solution or just want to make my code look better, you can simply commit an issue or a PR. For further communication, email me via mczsjzsjz@icloud.com or contact me by QQ 2370706289.
